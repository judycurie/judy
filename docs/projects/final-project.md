# Final Project


My participation in Fab Academy 2023 is sponsored by Eurepean Union  (EU funding: 101033646).
One of the goals of my OPTIshell research project is to build a prototype of the timber solar canopy structure covered with the PV material.
More about the project [optishell.io](https://optishell.io/).
During Fab Academy I would like to build a stiffness-scaled model in 1:10 or 1:18 scale.

## Weekly notes

### Week 01
Base idea:a 1:10 model from laser cut thin plywood, filling the spaces with the plate panels, 3D print the foundation structures.

IO additions and difficulty level (+++):
:	add PV elements on some of the plates, connect to battery and show the level of the battery (++);create a sensor at the bottom to remotely display if the place is occupied (+);create a simple machine to erect the structure e.g. an extendable tube in the middle(+++);add sensor of the wind to inform if the wind is too strong (alternatively dismount) (+++)

## Spiral Development

### Spiral 01
**01.1 Objectives:**

- [ ] 1) static 1:10 stiffness-scaled model from laser cut thin plywood - single layer laths,

- [ ] 2) filling the spaces with the plate panels

- [ ] 3) 3D printed the foundation structures

- [ ] 4) IO - a sensor showing if the space is occupied (remotely)?


### Spiral 02

**02.1 Objectives:**

- [ ] 1) a static 1:10 stiffness-scaled model from laser cut thin plywood - double layer laths,

- [ ] 2) filling the spaces with the plate panels + cover with small solar cells

- [ ] 3) 3D printed the foundation structures + installed batteries

- [ ] 4) IO - a sensor showing if the space is occupied (remotely)? + level of battery display

### Spiral 03

** 03.1 Objectives:**

- [ ] 1) a KINETIC 1:10 stiffnes-scaled model from laser cut thin plywood 

- [ ] 2) filling the spaces with the plate panels + cover with small solar cells

- [ ] 3) 3D printed the foundation structures + installed batteries

- [ ] 4) IO - a sensor showing if the space is occupied (remotely)? + level of battery display

- [ ] 5) a small machine for self-assembly
